        <h1>About Parkinson's Disease</h1>
        
        <h2>Stages of Parkinson's Disease</h2>
        
        <h3>Stage 1: Mild Symptoms</h3>
        <p>In the early stages of Parkinson's disease, symptoms are usually mild and may include tremors or shaking in one limb, slight changes in posture or facial expressions, and soft speech.</p>
        
        <h3>Stage 2: Moderate Symptoms</h3>
        <p>As the disease progresses, symptoms become more noticeable. Tremors and rigidity may affect both sides of the body, walking may become more difficult, and facial expressions may be reduced.</p>
        
        <h3>Stage 3: Significant Impairment</h3>
        <p>In stage 3, symptoms become more severe and interfere with daily activities. Balance and coordination are significantly affected, making it challenging to perform tasks such as dressing, eating, or bathing independently.</p>
        
        <h3>Stage 4: Severe Symptoms</h3>
        <p>At this stage, symptoms are severe, and individuals may require assistance with daily activities. Walking may require the use of a walker or assistance from another person, and stiffness and bradykinesia (slowness of movement) are prominent.</p>
        
        <h3>Stage 5: Advanced Parkinson's</h3>
        <p>In the final stage of Parkinson's disease, individuals are often unable to walk or stand without assistance. They may experience significant rigidity and bradykinesia, and may also experience hallucinations and delusions.</p>
        
        <p>Please note that the progression of Parkinson's disease can vary from person to person, and not everyone will experience all of these stages. It is important to work closely with healthcare professionals to manage symptoms and develop a personalized treatment plan.</p>
