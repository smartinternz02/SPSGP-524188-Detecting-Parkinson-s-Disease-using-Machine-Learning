        <h1>Parkinson's Disease</h1>
        
        <p>Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement control. It is characterized by the progressive loss of dopamine-producing cells in the brain. As a result, individuals with Parkinson's disease may experience a range of symptoms, including tremors, stiffness, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), and postural instability.</p>
        
        <p>While the exact cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown, both genetic and environmental factors are believed to play a role. There is currently no cure for Parkinson's disease, but various treatment options are available to manage the symptoms and improve quality of life.</p>
        
        <p>It is important to consult with healthcare professionals for an accurate diagnosis and to develop a personalized treatment plan tailored to individual needs.</p>
        
        <p>If you suspect you or a loved one may have Parkinson's disease, it is recommended to seek medical advice for proper evaluation and guidance.</p>
